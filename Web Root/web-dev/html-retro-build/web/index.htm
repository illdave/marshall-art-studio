								1998: With the help of Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Kemper Group escaped from 
								insuring automobiles in Massachusetts, where it lost $50 million in 1997. 
								Kemper created an independent firm called Arabella Mutual Insurance Co. 
								to take over its auto lines on October first. Kemper blames its Bay State losses on high accident rates, 
								soaring cases of theft and fraud, out-of-date insurance laws, 
								a poorly designed risk pool, and compulsory insurance. For more information on this actual story,

								1983: Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Mark Terry was injured in a collision while driving an insured vehilce. 
								Kemper paid up, but Terry's lawer Albert Cioffi forged Terry's signature and kept the money himself. 
								Cioffi was caught and charged with larceny, did time and got disbarred. Terry sued Kemper for paying not 
								paying him directly. The case was dismissed since Cioffi was Terry's authorized agent.

								 of the <a href="https://socialaw.com" alt="">Social Law Library</a> in 1998.
