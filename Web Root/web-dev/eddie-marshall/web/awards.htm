		<h3>San Francisco Chronicle, SFJazz Beacon Award</h3>

		<h3>Stella Cheung Houston, JazzNow</h3>
		<p>"Eddie Marshall is still my favorite drummer, it was wonderful to watch him play. To hear drums so sensitively played is mesmerizing. How can one play drums so softly and unobtrusively even to the softly spoken bass, and yet keeping perfect time! His sticks and brushes danced on the instruments. It was so graceful! It seemed so effortless!"</p>

		<h3>Thomas Lindley, JazzTimes</h3>
		<p>"Jazz Drummer Eddie Marshall was chosen to receive the first Annual SFJazz Beacon Award at the 18th Annual San Francisco Jazz Festival this past November. Marshall was quoted as saying the award was "totally unexpected . . . It's not often a side man, like a drummer, gets an award." Yet according to SFJazz, "he is the embodiment of the beacon ... he's extended jazz in the Bay Area into exciting new areas and inspired countless other musicians."</p>

		<h3>Wayne Saroyan, JazzWest</h3>
		<p>"Marshall enthralled the audience (and his fellow musicians) with his superb skills on alto recorder. Holy Mischief led the evening with a comfortable mainstream trio of tunes. He then returned for two quartet reunion groups. The first was fronted by Bobby McFerrin (with pianist Paul Nagel and Jeff Carney on acoustic bass). Their three-song set was capped by a sublime rendition of Miles Davis' "Selim". The second reunion was of The Fourth Way (Michael White on violin, Mike Nock on piano, and Bob McClure on bass). The night finished with an all-star finale, "Sandu." With jazz this fine in our own neighborhood, who needs New York?"</p>

			<p>"I'm experimenting with doing odd times, like nine, seven, six, or five, but without accenting the <em>one</em>."</p>
			<p>"I really want to bring back West Coast Jazz. I'm so tired of East Coast this, New York that."</p>
			<p>"When I grew up I heard...we were over-saturated with jazz. We would hear Louis Jordan, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, of course Nat King Cole, Ella...you know all black artists.</p>
			<p>"That's the way I grew up in a black neighborhood. So I liked it but it was... I just liked the R&B stuff. The closest I came to liking jazz was a guy named Earl Bostic. He was a killer alto player who played R&amp;B type stuff and that's what my Uncle Cookie was, an R&B player along with ballads."</p>
			<p>"... my uncle got drafted and left me these jazz records, I switched over night! He had Charlie Parker With Strings, Milestones, and Max Roach. Max Roach and Bud Powell."</p>
