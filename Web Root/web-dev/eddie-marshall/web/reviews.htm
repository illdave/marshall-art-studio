		<p><strong><a href="http://www.bobbymcferrin.com" rel="external">Bobby McFerrin</a>:</strong> "An inspired composer ... one of the best drummers in the business ... hits hard and swings all at the same time."</p>
		<p><strong>J. Robert Bragonier, <a href="http://www.52ndstreet.com/reviews/mainstream/marshall_mischief.html" rel="external">52nd Street</a>:</strong> "Eddie Marshall is a leading figure in the evolution of San Francisco's contemporary jazz sound, a complex, modern, "post-bop thing" with intensity, occasional unexpected meter changes, and frequent whole tone and modal excursions."</p>
		<p><strong>J. Denai M. Burbank, <a href="http://www.jazzreview.com/cdreview.cfm?ID=1523" rel="external">JazzReview</a>:</strong> "... no wonder he's in demand. The West Coast group gives a performance that's lively, reserved, classy and soulful. Marshall has had it for a long time, and the jazz world knows it. Don't miss this one. If jazz be your food of choiceâ€¦eat on!"</p>
		<p><strong><a href="http://www.stereotimes.com/mr120199.shtm" rel="external">StereoTimes</a>:</strong> "His exciting collaboration with San Francisco's best young players is reflected in the contemporary nature of his original music. He is considered a major leader in the evolution of a West Coast jazz sound ..."</p>

		<p><strong>Wayne Saroyan, <a href="http://www.jazzwest.com/archive/articles/marshall_rev.html" rel="external">JazzWest</a>:</strong> "Marshall enthralled the audience (and his fellow musicians) with his superb skills on alto recorder. Holy Mischief led the evening with a comfortable mainstream trio of tunes. He then returned for two quartet reunion groups. The first was fronted by Bobby McFerrin (with pianist Paul Nagel and Jeff Carney on acoustic bass). Their three-song set was capped by a sublime rendition of Miles Davis' "Selim". The second reunion was of The Fourth Way (Michael White on violin, Mike Nock on piano, and Bob McClure on bass). The night finished with an all-star finale, "Sandu." With jazz this fine in our own neighborhood, who needs New York?"</p>
		<p><strong>Stella Cheung Houston, <a href="http://www.jazznow.com/801Articles/StnfrdF.html" rel="external">JazzNow</a>:</strong> "Eddie Marshall is still my favorite drummer, it was wonderful to watch him play. To hear drums so sensitively played is mesmerizing. How can one play drums so softly and unobtrusively even to the softly spoken bass, and yet keeping perfect time! His sticks and brushes danced on the instruments. It was so graceful! It seemed so effortless!"</p>	
		<p><strong>Thomas Lindley, <a href="http://www.jazztimes.com/JazzNews/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=41" rel="external">JazzTimes</a>:</strong> "Jazz Drummer Eddie Marshall was chosen to receive the first Annual SFJazz Beacon Award at the 18th Annual San Francisco Jazz Festival this past November. Marshall was quoted as saying the award was "totally unexpected . . . It's not often a side man, like a drummer, gets an award." Yet according to SFJazz, "he is the embodiment of the beacon ... he's extended jazz in the Bay Area into exciting new areas and inspired countless other musicians."</p>
