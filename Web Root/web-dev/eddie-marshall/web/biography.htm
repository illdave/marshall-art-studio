		<p>Coming from a family of musicians in Springfield Massachusetts, Eddie Marshall is acknowledged as a leading figure in the evolution of San Francisco's contemporary jazz sound. For over fifty years he has played drums with nearly every major name in jazz, from Freddie Hubbard, Jon Hendricks and Dexter Gordon to Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Eddie Harris. A consummate sideman, Marshall was the designated house drummer at San Francisco's famed nightclub, Keystone Korner during the 1970s. His most long-standing musical associations have been with Toshiko Akiyoshi, with whom he has played since 1958, the late Stan Getz, Bobby Hutcherson and Bobby McFerrin. He co-founded with <a href="http://www.jazz-planet.com/~manock" title="Mike Nock - Jazz Planet" rel="external" class="linkout">Mike Nock</a> the seminal jazz fusion group, The Fourth Way. Since 1989 Marshall has also been performing on the alto and soprano recorders, working within a large variety of ensemble arrangements on a baroque instrument rarely heard in jazz.</p>

		<p>While playing with many of the greatest jazz musicians of his day, Eddie Marshall has also distinguished himself as a composer. With two albums of original music to his name, his work is appreciated for both its driving intensity and joyous, melodic lyricism. Chamber Music America with support from the Doris Duke Foundation awarded Marshall two grants through their New Works and New Works Encore Program, commissioning him to compose an original piece. "Dreams That Dance- A Suite", performed by Marshall's <a href="http://www.eddiemarshall.com/holy-mischief-cd.htm" title="Eddie Marshall: Holy Mischief">Holy Mischief</a> Ensemble, premiered at the San Francisco Jazz Festival in November 2004. </p>
		<p>Since 1981 Marshall has maintained an active teaching schedule in addition to his busy performance career. He has taught traps, jazz theory, composition, and small and big band arranging at The Stanford Jazz Workshop and Rhythmic Concepts Jazz Camp since 1984. Part of San Francisco Symphony's Adventures in Music series throughout the 1990’s, he has also taught ensemble classes at The Jazz School in Berkeley. He has led several free after-school instrument instruction programs, including guitarist Bruce Forman’s innovative JazzMasters Workshop for which he was the Bay Area director.</p>
		<p>In 2000 the SF Jazz Festival honored Marshall with its first annual Beacon Award, celebrating his lifelong commitment to jazz music and education.  From 2000 to 2003 Marshall served as the Music Chair of the San Francisco Arts Commission. Since 2007 Eddie Marshall has toured and recorded with the great vibraphonist, Bobby Hutcherson, continuing a more than 30 year collaboration, which according to Marshall, has been one of the highlights of his career.</p>

			<h2>Beginnings</h2>
			<img src="images/sidebar/biography.gif" width="200" height="100" alt="Photo of Eddie with one of his Grandsons -- and his friend" />
			<p>I started taking lessons at sixteen or seventeen. Basically, I got my chops up and, after a while, I could really read pretty well. I didn't realize that drumming was just on one line, so I would get all these gigs playing in the theatres because nobody could read music. The drummers couldn't read music. They would always have to bring somebody in from New York to Springfield. But they'd say, "We've got this kid in Springfield, he can read!" So all through high school I played in shows, I played in "Music In The Round", I played in these Catskills-type clubs with a singer, dancer, and comedian every night.</p>

			<h3>Bobby Hutcherson</h3>
			<p>Easily the most accomplished vibraphonist of his generation, <a href="http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist.aspx?ob=art&src=rslt&aid=2946" title="Bobby Hutcherson - Verve Music Group" rel="external" class="linkout">Bobby Hutcherson</a> is a master of melodic, harmonic and rhythmic improvisation on both the vibes and the marimba. He has performed or recorded with nearly every major living jazz musician.</p>
