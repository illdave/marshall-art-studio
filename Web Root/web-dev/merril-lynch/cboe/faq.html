Listing call options onjust 16 stocks, CBOE traded 911 contracts on that first day of business.In 1977, put options were introduced.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle" ALIGN="left">How bigis the trading floor, and what does it take to keep it operational?</SPAN><P>The CBOE's 45,000square-foot trading floor opened for trading in February of 1984. Theexchange is cabled with more than 50,000 miles of electrical wire, mostof it beneath the trading floor. There is enough phone cable to serve acity of 200,000 people; and more information display screens under oneroof than any other building in the world. The concentration oftechnology requires as much electricity as the nearby 110-story SearsTower.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is the OCC?</SPAN><P>The Options ClearingCorporation is the sole issuer of all securities options listed at theCBOE, four other U.S. stock exchanges and the National Association ofSecurities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and is the entity through which allCBOE option transactions are ultimately cleared. As the issuer of alloptions, OCC essentially takes the opposite side of every option traded.Because OCC basically becomes the buyer for every seller and the sellerfor every buyer, it allows options traders to buy and sell in asecondary market without having to find the original opposite party.<BR><BR>The OCC substantially reduces the credit risk aspect oftrading securities options as the OCC requires that every buyer andevery seller have a clearing member and that both sides of thetransaction are matched. It also has the authority to make margin callson firms during the trading day. The OCC has a AAA credit rating fromStandard &amp; Poor's Corporation.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a market-maker?</SPAN><P>Market-makers provideliquidity in option trading by risking their own capital for personaltrading, and are the backbone of the CBOE's trading system. They takethe opposite side of public orders by competing in an open outcryauction market. Floor brokers, on the other hand, act only as agents,executing orders for public or firm accounts.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Does a &quot;specialist&quot;buy and sell options?</SPAN><P>Most option classeslisted at the CBOE are traded in an open outcry system where certainmembers of the Exchange may trade as market-makers. Market-makersprovide liquidity in option trading by risking their own capital forpersonal trading, and are the backbone of the CBOE's trading system.They take the opposite side of public orders by competing in an openoutcry auction market. This differs from the trading environment on manyother exchanges where &quot;specialists&quot; are allowed to acceptorders from the public, to manage the public order book and to deal fortheir own accounts in the same securities.		<P><BR><SPAN CLASS="title"><a name="options">Options - Definitions, Terms &amp; Concepts</a></SPAN>		<P><BR><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is an option?</SPAN><P>A stock option is acontract which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buyor sell shares of the underlying security or index at a specific pricefor a specified time. Stock option contracts generally are for 100shares of the underlying stock. There are two types of options, callsand puts.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a call option?</SPAN><P>A call option gives thebuyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying securityat a specific price for a specified time. The seller of a call optionhas the obligation to sell the underlying security should the buyerexercise his option to buy.<P> <SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a put option?</SPAN><P>A put option gives thebuyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying securityat a specific price for a specified time. The seller of a put option hasthe obligation to buy the underlying security should the buyer choose toexercise his option to sell.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is the option premium?</SPAN><P>The premium is the priceat which the contract trades. The premium is the price of the option andis paid by the buyer to the writer, or seller, of the option. In return,the writer of the call option is obligated to deliver the underlyingsecurity to an option buyer if the call is exercised or buy theunderlying security if the put is exercised. The writer keeps thepremium whether or not the option is exercised.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a strike price?</SPAN><P>The strike, or exercise,price of an option is the specified share price at which the shares ofstock can be bought or sold by the buyer if he exercises the right tobuy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put).<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is an at-the-money option? An in-the-money option? An out-of- the moneyoption?</SPAN><P>When the price of theunderlying security is equal to the strike price, an option isat-the-money. A call option is in-the-money if the strike price is lessthan the market price of the underlying security. A put option isin-the-money if the strike price is greater than the market price of theunderlying security. A call option is out-of- the-money if the strikeprice is greater than the market price of the underlying security. A putoption is out-of-the money if the strike price is less than the marketprice of the underlying security.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a contract size of an equity option?</SPAN><P>The amount of theunderlying asset covered by the options contract. This is 100 shares forone option unless adjusted for a special event, such as a stock split ora stock dividend.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is open interest?</SPAN><P>Open interest refers tothe number of outstanding option contracts in the exchange market or ina particular class or series.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Whatdoes it mean to be exercised or assigned on an option transaction?</SPAN><P>When you buy an optionyou have the right to either purchase or sell stock at a predeterminedprice. When and if you choose to purchase or sell stock at thatpredetermined price you are said to be &quot; exercising your right&quot;.<BR><BR>Whenyou sell an option you now have the obligation to sell or purchasestock. You have or may not have to fulfill that obligation. You areconsidered to be &quot;assigned&quot; if you are being required tofulfill that obligation. Typically this occurs when the option isin-the-money.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What happens to my option if I do nothing?</SPAN><P>If you bought a call orput you would lose the premium you paid for the option plus whatevercommissions and fees incurred on that transaction. If you sold a call ora put and your option is in-the-money you will most likely be assignedand you will have to sell or buy stock.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">When can I anticipate being assigned?</SPAN><P>You can anticipate beingassigned any time your option becomes in the money. Individual investorsmay be automatically assigned or exercised at expiration by The OptionsClearing Corporation if the option is 3/4 of a point or more in themoney. Also, most brokerage firms have rules under which options will beautomatically exercised; check with your broker to determine whichautomatic exercise rule may apply.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a European-style and American-style option?</SPAN><P>American-style is anoption contract that can be exercised at any time between the date ofpurchase and the expiration date. Most exchange-traded options areAmerican-style. All stock options are American-style. European-style isan option contract that can only be exercised on the expiration date.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is the expiration date?</SPAN><P>The last day (in the caseof American-style) or the only day (in the case of European-style) onwhich an option may be exercised. For stock options, this date is theSaturday immediately following the third Friday of the expiration month;however, brokerage firms may set an earlier deadline for notification ofan option buyer's intention to exercise. If Friday is a holiday, thelast trading day will be the preceding Thursday.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What isthe last full day of trading in the Equities, OEX and SPX? How do theysettle?</SPAN><P>The last full day oftrading for Equities and OEX is the 3rd Friday of the month. They settleon the close. The last full day of trading for SPX is the Thursdaybefore the 3rd Friday of the month. SPX settles on the opening of the500 stocks that make up the index on Friday morning. Friday holidayspush all of these dates ahead one day.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is a strike price and how are they determined?</SPAN><P>A strike price is theactual numeric value of the option. For example, a May option may havestrike prices of 45, 50 and 55. Strike prices are determined when theunderlying reaches a certain numeric value and trades consistently at orabove that value. If, for example, XYZ stock was trading at 49, hit aprice of 50 and traded consistently at this level, the next higheststrike may be added.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What happens to my order after I enter it with my broker?</SPAN><P>Your order may take manyroutes depending on your broker and the firm that represents them on thefloor. Most likely it will be routed electronically to CBOE's OrderRouting System (ORS). ORS is a network of communication lines fromretail member firms computers that collect and route wire orders of upto 2,000 contracts to one of three trading floor locations: booth, crowdor CBOE's Order Book Official, based on price and volume parameters setby each member firm and CBOE. It is the access system to the ElectronicBook (EB), Retail Automatic Execution System (RAES), and Floor BrokerRouting (FBR).<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What isthe RAES system? How can I tell if a options series is RAES eligible?</SPAN><P>RAES is a part of CBOE'sORS system that automatically executes customer market and marketablelimit orders of 10 contracts or less at the prevailing market quote inthe most active series. Marketable limits are defined as orders to buyat a limit price equal to or greater than the market offer, or to sellat a price equal to or less than the market bid. RAES provides retailcustomers with a guaranteed firm quote and instantaneous turnaround time to the originating branch office while reducing member firms'execution, fill reporting and trade match key punching costs. It makesCBOE's price reporting more timely and efficient while providing anaccurate time and sales audit.<BR><BR>Option series in equities thatclosed at a premium of 10 or less the night before will be available onRAES in all expiration months. Option series in the indices that closedat a premium of 7 or less will be listed in the front 2 months. Also ifyou have a vendor service, series that are RAES eligible are usuallyhighlighted with an A for Automation or somehow designated that it isRAES eligible.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle"><a name="placingorder">Can I place my order directly with the CBOE?</a></SPAN><P>No. All orders must be entered through your broker.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Isthere a difference between the reporting of last sales and the reportingof quotes?</SPAN><P>Yes. The CBOE employsPrice Reporters to manually enter the sell side of trades. The PriceReporter then keypunches this information into CBOE's audit trailsystem. A Quote Reporter is also employed by the CBOE and is responsiblefor standing in the trading pit and listening for the best bids andoffers as they are yelled out in our &quot;open outcry system&quot;.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What is Time and Sales?</SPAN><P>Time and Sales is CBOE'saudit trail of last sales and quotes. It lists this information by time.		 <P><BR><SPAN CLASS="title"><a name="leaps">Common Questions about LEAPS</a></SPAN>		<P><BR><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What are Equity LEAPS?</SPAN><P>Equity LEAPS, orLong-term Equity AnticPation Securities are long-dated put and calloptions on common stock or ADRs. These long-term options provide theholder the right to purchase, in the case of a call, or sell, in thecase of a put, a specified number of stock shares at a pre-determinedprice up to the expiration date of the option, which can be three yearsin the future.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Whatdetermines if LEAPS are available on a particular stock?</SPAN><P>LEAPS trade on a selectlist of optionable stocks. Currently, LEAPS are available on about 10%of the stocks on which options are traded at the CBOE. The Chicago BoardOptions Exchange regularly reviews its options products and periodicallylists new Equity LEAPS. An updated CBOE LEAPS list can be obtained byaccessing the CBOE FaxLine (Call1-800-OPTIONS and press [4] [1], the document codes are #400 and #402 )or by calling the  Options Clearing Corporation at 1-800-OPTIONS to receive the list via mail.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">When do LEAPS expire? When can LEAPS be exercised?</SPAN><P>As with equity options,the expiration date is the Saturday following the third Friday of theexpiration month. All equity LEAPS contracts expire in the month ofJanuary. Equity options and Equity LEAPS are subject to &quot;Americanstyle&quot; exercise. This means the holder has the right to exercisethe options on any business day prior to expiration.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">How do I know when the next January expiring LEAPS will be listed?</SPAN><P>All new January expiring equity LEAPS are initially listed on the first business day (usually a Monday) following the expiration in either May, June, or July each year.  The month that the LEAP is initially listed in is dependent upon the quarterly cycle of the option.  Cycle 1 options January expiring LEAPS are listed after the expiration in May, cycle 2 after the expiration in June, and cycle 3 after the expiration in July.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">What can Equity LEAPS do for me?</SPAN><P>As with regular equityoptions, the owner (or holder) of an Equity LEAPS call has the right topurchase, or sell in the case of a put, a pre-determined amount ofstock, known as the contract size, at a pre-determined price, called thestrike price, for a specified period of time. For Equity LEAPS, thespecified period of time, or duration of this option, can be up to 3years into the future. LEAPS calls can provide an investor with a mediumto long-term investment view the opportunity to participate in theupward movement of a stock without making an outright stock purchase.LEAPS puts can provide a medium to long-term insurance or hedge forstock owners in the event of a substantial decline in their stocks.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">How popular are Equity LEAPS?</SPAN><P>Since their introductionby the CBOE in 1990, open interest in equity LEAPS at the CBOE hasincreased to a record 4.6 million contracts by the end of February 1999(representing over 460 million shares of stock).<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">If anexchange offers LEAPS on an equity option, how would I distinguishbetween a regular January 1999 option, a January 2000 LEAP, and a January 2001 LEAP?</SPAN><P>Just as a standard optionhas its' own unique option symbols, equity LEAPS also have unique &quot;root&quot;symbols that allow investors to distinguish between the variety ofoptions currently available on a particular stock. An example would be:<BR><BR>IBM(Standard Option expires January 1999): IBM January 80 Call<BR><BR>IBM (LEAPS Option expires January 2000): LIB January 80 Call<br><br>IBM (LEAPS Option expires January 2001): ZIB January 80 Call<br><br>LEAPSsymbols are listed in the <A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/TradersTools.asp?cid=symba&SubMenu=Leaps&sid=A">Symbol  Directory</A>.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Can Ipurchase LEAPS directly from the Chicago Board Options Exchange?</SPAN><P>No. LEAPS must bepurchased like all other option securities, via a broker dealer or acomputer trading network.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Whatare the trading hours for Equity LEAPS Options?</SPAN><P>As with regular equityoptions, the trading hours for Equity LEAPS are from 8:30 a.m. to 3:02 p.m.Central Time (Chicago time).</span>					</div>				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</body></html>
