A three-month 78.00 strike call option is trading for 3-1/8. You may purchase two of these at-the-money calls for a total price of $625 (3.125 x 2 x $100 = $625). You risk the entire $625 if YZX does not climb above the 78 mark at the end of the three months. Outlined in the chart below are several scenarios at the end of the three months.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Outcome 1: YZX rose by 10 percent.</SPAN><P>Your forecast was realized, and the YZX settlement value was calculated as 85.80 on the day before expiration. You can exercise your call and receive the in-the-money amount of $7.80 (85.80 - 78.00 = $7.80) per contract for a total of $1,560 ($7.80 x 2 x $100 = $1,560). Your profit is $935 ($1,560 - $625 = $935).<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Outcome 2: YZX rose by 2.5 percent.</SPAN><P>You were correct in direction but wrong in magnitude. The YZX settlement value at expiration is calculated as 79.95. The call buyer can exercise and receive an in-the-money amount of $1.95 (79.95 - 78.00 = $1.95) per contract, for a total of $390 ($1.95 x 2 x $100 = $390). Although the call ends up in-the-money, there is a net loss of $235 ($625 - $390 = $235) on the investment because the in-the-money amount is less than the price paid. For these calls to break even, YZX would have to move approximately 4 percent to a level of 81.125. The break-even is calculated as the strike price plus the premium paid [(78.00 + 3.125) x 100 = 8,112.50].<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Outcome 3: YZX remained at or below 78.</SPAN><P>You were incorrect in the timing and direction of your forecast, and the market has not risen above the strike price level. In this case, you lose the entire call option investment of $625. This is the maximum you can lose, no matter how far YZX falls.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">Buy YZX Call Strategy - Summary</SPAN><P><TABLE CLASS="TblBgcolor" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0" ALIGN="center"><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4" ><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblTitle" COLSPAN="5">Possible outcomes of investing in two YZX 78.00 calls<BR> at a premium of    3-1/8</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblHeader">LEVEL OF YZX at expiration</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblHeader">Move in the YZX Index</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblHeader">Expiration value of two 78.00 calls</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblHeader">Less: premium paid (2 calls @ 3-1/8)</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblHeader">Net gain/loss*</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">70.2</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">-10%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">0.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">74.1</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">-5%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">0.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">76.05</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">-2.50%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">0.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">78</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">0%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">0.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">79.95</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">2.50%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">390.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-235.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">81.9</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">5%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">780.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">155.00</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">85.8</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Center">10%</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">1,560.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">-625.00</TD>	<TD CLASS="TblContent9Right">935.00</TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><SPAN CLASS="content9">* Exclusive of commissions and taxes</SPAN>    <P><TABLE CLASS="TblBgcolor" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" CELLPADDING="0" ALIGN="center"><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4" ><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblTitle" COLSPAN="2">Basics of Call Purchase</TD></TR><TR>	<TD CLASS="TblHeaderLt">Profit & loss characteristics</TD>	<TD CLASS="content9">Profit potential will be theoretically unlimited.
