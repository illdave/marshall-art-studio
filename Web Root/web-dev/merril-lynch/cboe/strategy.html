Although buying calls may not be suitable for everyone, itallows the investor the opportunity to profit from an upward move in theunderlying stock while having very little capital at risk compared tothe amount needed to own the stock.<P><BR><SPAN CLASS="title">Definition</SPAN><P>Buying a call gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy theunderlying stock at a specified price (the strike price) within aspecific period of time. The risk for the call buyer is limited to thepremium paid for the call (the price of the call) plus commissions. Theprofit potential is unlimited as the underlying stock rises above thebreakeven price (strike price plus the premium paid for the call pluscommissions.) The value of the call tends to increase as the price ofthe underlying stock rises. This gain will increasingly reflect a risein the value of the underlying stock when the market price moves abovethe option's strike price.<P><BR><SPAN CLASS="title">How to Buy a Call to Participate        in the Upward Movement of a Stock While Limiting Your Downside Risk</SPAN><P>In this example ZYX is trading at 44 1/4. Instead of spending $22,125 for500 shares of ZYX stock, an investor could purchase a six-month callwith a 45 strike price for 3 3/8. By purchasing a six month call with a45 strike for 3 3/8, the investor is saying that he anticipates ZYX willrise above the strike of 45 (which is where ZYX can be purchased nomatter how high ZYX has risen) + 3 3/8 (the option premium), or 48 3/8,by expiration. Each call represents 100 shares of stock, so 5 callscould be bought in place of 500 shares of stock. The cost of 5 calls at3 3/8 is $1,687.50 (5 calls x 3 3/8 x $100). Instead of spending $22,125on stock, only $1,687.50 is needed for the purchase of the 5 calls. Thebalance of $20,437.50 could then be invested in short-term instruments.This investor has unlimited profit potential as ZYX rises above 48 3/8.The risk for the option buyer is limited to the premium paid, which inthis example is $1,687.50. Commissions and taxes have not been takeninto consideration in these examples, although they can have asignificant affect on the investor's returns.<P>Buying 5 ZYX 6-Month 45 Calls at 3 3/8 vs. Buying 500 Shares ZYX @ 44 1/4. We willdiscuss three possible scenarios at expiration.<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">I. ZYX is above 48 3/8 by expiration.</SPAN><P>If ZYX is at 51 at expiration, the option will be        worth the difference between the strike and the current price of the        stock:<P>$51 (current price)<P>-45 (strike price)<P>$6 (current option value)<P>The option could be sold and a        77% return would be earned on the initial investment.<P>$6(current option value)<P>$3 3/8 (premium paid for option)<P>$2 5/8 (profit, if option sold)<P>The 5 calls could also be        exercised and 500 shares of ZYX would be purchased for $45 per share        even though the stock is trading at $51 per share. The right to buy the        stock at 45 cost 3 3/8 so the breakeven on the stock position in ZYX is        48 3/8 plus commissions.<P>Had the stock been purchased at 44 1/4        (a cost of $22,125), and it rose to 51, it would now be worth $25,500.        This would be a 15.3% increase in value over the original cost of        $22,125. But, the call buyer spent only $1,687.50 and earned 77% on his        options.<P><TABLE CLASS="TblBgcolor" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" WIDTH=400 ALIGN="center"><TR>	<TD VALIGN="top">	<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"  CELLPADDING="4">	<CAPTION CLASS="TblTitle">Had Stock Been Purchased</CAPTION>	<TR>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top">Stock Purchase Price</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top">Initial Cost of Stock - 500 Shares</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top">Stock Price at Exp.</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top">Value <BR>of Stock <BR>at<BR> Exp.**</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top">Change<BR> in Stock Value</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">44 1/4</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$22,125</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="center">51</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$25,500</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$3,375</TD>	</TR>	</TABLE>	</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE CLASS="TblBgcolor" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="5" WIDTH=400 ALIGN="center">		<TR>	<TD VALIGN="top">	<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0"  CELLPADDING="4">	<CAPTION CLASS="TblTitle">Had Call Options Been Purchased</CAPTION>	<TR>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" valign="top">Option Price <br>Per Contract</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" valign="top">Initial Total Cost - 5 Options</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" valign="top">Option<br> Price<br> Per Contract at Exp.</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" valign="top">Total Value of Options</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblHeader" ALIGN="CENTER" valign="top">Change<br> in <br>Options Value</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">3 3/8</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$1,687.50</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="center">6</b></TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$3,000</TD>		<TD CLASS="TblContent" ALIGN="CENTER">$1,312.50*</TD>	</TR>	</TABLE></TR></TABLE>	<SPAN CLASS="Content9">*Plus interest earned on cash not used, cost of stock less call premium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Plus dividends if any.</SPAN>		<P><SPAN CLASS="SubTitle">II. - ZYX is between 45 and 48 3/8 at expiration</SPAN><P>The investor's option will still hold some value if the underlying is between 45 and 48 3/8 (breakeven), but not enough to breakeven on the position.

The option can be sold to close out the position through the last trading day of the call.  ZYX did rise in value, but not as much as anticipated.  The option that cost 3 3/8 is now worth 2 points.

Currently,there are short-term options listed on more than 1700 stocks and morethan 200 of those stocks also have LEAPS&reg;, Long-term EquityAnticiPation Securities&#153;, which are simply long-term stock andindex options. Today's investors have a choice of short-term andlong-term expirations, as well as multiple strike prices, so no matterwhat their outlook is, there is a call which correlates with theirmarket opinion. The owner of a call has the opportunity to profit from arise in the stock with very little capital at stake compared to theamount necessary to buy the underlying security. The most that a call owner can lose is the amount paid for the option, yet he has unlimitedprofit potential as the stock rises above the strike price.<P><BR><A NAME="worksheets"><SPAN CLASS="title">Buy Call Strategy Worksheets</SPAN></A><P><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.cboe.com/images/buy-call.gif" WIDTH="357" HEIGHT="227" BORDER="0"></CENTER><P><BR><SPAN CLASS="title">On-line Buy Call Strategy Applet</SPAN><P>Try the<A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=ap1">Buy Call Strategy Applet</A>.
