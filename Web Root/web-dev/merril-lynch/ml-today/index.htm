Online business cash management is no longer in its infancy. Revenue from the 
transactions of corporate customers of electronic banking services accounts 
for 37 percent of cash management revenue today and is expected to account 
for 47 percent by 2005 — an increase of $4 billion, according to 
The Tower Group.*<p> 

Demand for online banking services is growing as evolving technology increases 
their convenience and cost-effectiveness. If you’re looking for ways to take your 
business banking online, you’ll need to consider what capabilities and functions 
will make your online experience convenient, secure and valuable for your business.<p> 

<b>Easy Access</b><br> 
Before you even begin to think about what functions you’ll need, make sure your 
online business banking service is easy to access. You’ll want an integrated 
suite of robust, easy-to-use 24-hour banking services with access to all 
financial activity through a single electronic portal. That online portal 
should be a source of account access, financial information, analytical 
tools and educational resources to help manage all aspects of your business’s 
lifecycle.<p> 
	
It’s likely that your cash management needs are more extensive and sophisticated 
today than ever before. Whatever your accounting and treasury service needs, you’ll 
want to consider these features in an online cash management service:<p>

<b>Information Reporting</b><br>
Look for a service that provides comprehensive balance and transaction reporting 
through a single account with a seamless link to your online portal. You’ll want 
access to current information about your account and loan balances, Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) and Fed wire transfers, checking and credit card activity and 
lockbox receipts. For added value, look for a service that allows you to view from 
one central account online information from all of your business and financial 
accounts, no matter what institution holds the account. To further your financial 
management abilities, you’ll want to make sure that balance and transaction 
reports can be downloaded into a variety of financial software applications.<p>

<b>Transaction Processing</b><br>
To eliminate your need for excess paperwork, make sure you can create and execute 
a variety of electronic receipt and disbursement transactions online. Electronic 
transactions are a reliable, cost-effective alternative to the traditional check 
settlement process.<p>


Both deposits and disbursements can be handled electronically. You can automate 
the collection of your client receivables, for example, and even require that the 
transaction be approved before it is executed. You can also automate the movement 
of funds in other business accounts to your central asset account, either in fixed 
amounts at periodic intervals or in transfers based on parameters that you select.<p> 

Look for a system that includes an electronic bill payment service, so you can 
pay bills on a timely basis. A business bill payment service is perfect for all 
of your vendor payments, from equipment purchases to the monthly rent payment. Your system should be able to handle one-time 
payments as well as repetitive payments.<p> 

To streamline payroll processing, look for a service that deposits payroll proceeds  
directly into employee accounts and lets you make your federal and state 
payroll tax payments online.<p> 

<b>Control Features</b><br> 
You may want to use online cash management applications to delegate daily 
administrative tasks to employees, yet ensure that you’ll maintain 
financial control. Your electronic cash management service should  include 
this feature.<p> 

You should be able to authorize who can create and release a transaction, 
designate who can access information and establish spending limit 
controls for transaction processing.<p> 

<b>Enhanced Security</b><br>
Protecting your financial data from unauthorized viewing and modification is vital. 
Your online cash management service should use state-of-the-art Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) technology, which is used worldwide to protect the integrity of data. 
To further strengthen security, you’ll want potential users of your service to 
pass through an extensive gateway before gaining access. Many services use only a 
two-tiered authentication platform, but you can find some that offer a three-tiered 
process that requires users to enter your company’s name, 
a user identification number and a password.<p>

<b>A Valuable Tool</b><br>
An online business banking service can be a valuable tool for day-to-day cash 
management. If you want to manage your cash flow better, talk 
with your financial consultant about choosing an online service that offers 
the optimum in management capabilities.</span><p>
