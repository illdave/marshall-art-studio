The deadline date for artwork is now officially April 20th. You must get your artwork in before this date. If you cannot deliver it peronally, you can send the work UPS to this address: Hans Rickheit, 81 Moreland Street, Somerville, MA 02145.Please be sure to includethe following info with your piece(s): Name, Address, Telephone #, and price (if any). If there is no price, we will assume that it is not for sale. Any money made from sales of artwork go exclusively to the artist. You may submit as many pieces as you ike; I cannot promise to exhibit them all, but we'll do my best. Also, if you have a preference for one of the four exhibit locations, be sure to let me know. We will try my best to accomodate everybody. Be forewarned: if any of the artwork is deemed to "controversial" or "adult" in theme (all work will be reviewed with the head curator of the Out-Of-The-Blue Gallery, who is co-sponsoring this event) it will have to be shown exclusively at the Zeitgeist Gallery for the shorter two-week exhibition that runs from May 13 - May 25. All work must be ready to hang. It must be durable. No scotch tape, please! If you have any questions about this, feel free to contact Hans Rickheit by telephone (617-776-1940) or e-mail (<a href="mailto:hansrickheit@hotmail.com">hansrickheit@hotmail.com</a>).<br><br>							<b>WEBSITE UPDATE, NEW POSTER</b> <span class="dateline">March 23, 2003</span><br>				Click onto the "Members Page" and you will see the line-up of people involved with this event.

Ignored, shunned and hated by their neighbors, they have struggled to carve themselves a niche in this harsh and unforgiving climate. Now the time has come to step out and declare themsleves reborn as vital members of society. Yea, cartoonists scattered throughout the hills and valleys of New England are summoned to assist this noble cause! It is time to join together and demonstrate to a sleeping populace that true artists are lurking among them.<br><br>			</td></tr>			</table>	</div></td>		<td width="6" bgcolor="orange" class="orange"><img src="images/spacer.gif" height="1" width="3"></td>	<td width="40%"><br></td>	</tr></table></body></html>
