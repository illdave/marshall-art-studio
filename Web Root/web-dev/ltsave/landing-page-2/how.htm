			<p>LTSave provides investment advice for retirement planning. We develop our advice using objective, well-established quantitative investment principles including asset allocation to construct a well-diversified portfolio for our customers. Our advice is particularized to the unique circumstances of each individual customer.</p>
			<p>All our advice is delivered through our service, which is available by registering at this Web site. Our service is based on our proprietary Wealth Awareness&trade; approach, which guides our customers step-by-step toward their retirement goals.</p>
			<p>For our customers, we evaluate their income needs in retirement, and the adequacy of their current savings strategies. We will also construct a new optimized portfolio for them, providing security selection, deferral, and diversification recommendations. Our advice is largely based on mutual funds, and proprietary/alternate investment options, company stock, or self-directed brokerage accounts if offered by an employer's retirement plan.</p>
			<p>Our service is unique. We are an independent investment advisory firm. We are paid by our customers. We do not benefit in any way from any recommendations that we make, other than from what our customers pay us, and the satisfaction of helping them realize their retirement goals.</p>
			<p>Our service is convenient, easy-to-use, and highly secure and private. Our trained and knowledgeable service staff is available to answer any questions that our customers may have.</p>
