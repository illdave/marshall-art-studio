		<h2>Cash</h2>
		<p>"Cash" refers not just to the change in your pocket, but also to savings and checking accounts and money market funds. The money market consists of short-term debt securities (typically maturing within a year) that have very low default risk and high liquidity. Money market securities include: U.S. Treasury bills, negotiable certificates of deposit, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, and others. Many of these securities trade in large denominations and therefore may be out of reach of individual investors. Shares in money market funds, however, can be easily purchased by small investors. These funds pool the resources of many investors and invest in a wide variety of money market securities. Investors in money market funds bear very little risk of loss of principal and can expect returns that slightly exceed those available on the federally insured savings or time accounts that are offered by banks.</p>
		
		<h2>Bonds</h2>
		<p>Bonds are medium-term and long-term debt securities issued by borrowers such as the U.S. federal government, federal agencies like the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLB), state and local governments, and corporations. A typical bond is issued with a face value of $1000, carries a fixed coupon interest rate that is paid every six months, and repays its face value when it "matures," at a stated date in the future. The coupon rate is called "simple interest", but the "yield" on the bond is a different kind of interest rate, which takes into account both the coupon and the capital gain (or loss) of the bond. The capital gain is the difference between the bond's current price and the price at which it was bought. The market prices of nearly all bonds vary inversely with their yields, which correspond to the going interest rates on bonds of similar risk and maturity. In other words, if interest rates (or yields) rise at a given point in time, the market prices of existing fixed-rate bonds will decline, if nothing else changes. And if interest rates fall, the market prices of the bonds will rise, all else being equal. Bonds are also sometimes issued as pure discount instruments (sometimes called "zero-coupon bonds"), which basically means that the bond is sold for less than its face value and pays no coupon, but returns the full face value when it matures. Or, sometimes bonds may carry an adjustable rather than a fixed coupon rate. Another common feature with corporate bonds (but not with Treasury bonds) is that they may be callable at the option of the borrower. This means that if interest rates decline, the borrower has the option of calling back the bond prior to its maturity and essentially canceling the debt by paying off the face value. Most bonds are rated by non-governmental agencies like Standard and Poor's (S&P) or Moody's. A grade is assigned based on the agency's estimation of the likelihood of default. For instance, S&P assigns a grade of AAA to its highest rated bonds. The convention is that bonds that carry an AAA, AA, A or BBB rating (in descending order of quality) are considered "investment grade." Bonds rated lower than BBB are considered "high-yield" or more pejoratively "junk" bonds. This is not to say that high-yield bonds are not legitimate investment vehicles; it simply means that these bonds are highly risky with the risk at times approaching that associated with owning stocks.</p>
		<p>From an investment standpoint, some exposure to bonds is generally required to construct an appropriate portfolio. Corporate bonds may not be an ideal direct investment for the average investor due to a relative lack of market liquidity. However, the necessary exposure can be accomplished by investing in bond mutual funds.</p>

		<h2>Stocks</h2>
		<p>Common stocks, also called "equities," represent shares of ownership of a corporation. Typically, each share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on any matter related to corporate governance at the corporation's annual general meeting. The common stock of most public corporations can be freely bought or sold on one or more stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. There are two important characteristics of common stock. First, the owners have a residual claim, which means that they rank last in claims on the corporation's income and assets. For instance, if a corporation declares bankruptcy and liquidates its assets, its stockholders are entitled to receive whatever cash is available only after other claimants, such as state or federal tax agencies, employees, bondholders, suppliers, and so forth have been paid. For an ongoing business, stockholders are entitled to that part of the operating income that remains after interest payments and tax obligations are settled. Management may opt to pay out this residual income in the form of a cash dividend or to reinvest it in the business. Second, the owners of common stock have limited liability, which means that the most that they can lose is their original investment, even if the corporation fails. This is in contrast to unincorporated businesses like sole proprietorships or some types of partnerships, where creditors can legally pursue even the personal assets of owners in settlement of their claims.</p>
		<div class="top"><p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p></div>				
		
		<p>It should be clear that stocks are riskier investments than either money market funds or bonds, but they offer the prospect of superior returns if the companies that they represent do well. A diversified selection of common stocks is an indispensable part of most investment portfolios. The proportion of stock in a portfolio is a function of the individual investor's risk tolerance and investment horizon. Investment advisers generally advocate greater stock exposure for individuals who have a relatively high risk tolerance and plan to maintain their investments for a long time before cashing out. The average investor can create a diversified holding of common stocks through stock mutual funds or a combination of stock mutual funds and individual stocks. A well-chosen stock mutual fund can provide diversification with an initial investment as low as $1000 (or even lower, if the investment is in the form of an automatic periodic investment program).</p>
