<p>Many investors feel, reasonably enough, that if an investment is bad, they should sell it and then invest their money in a better asset. It is impossible to argue with the intention. But professionals have learned, and many individual investors will learn to their regret, that it is next to impossible to carry out this intention consistently.</p>
<p>The mistake-and experience will show that, as often as not, it is a mistake-lies in supposing that the past performance of a fund (or stock), even very recent past performance, is a guide to future performance. Remember what the mutual fund prospectuses say when reporting fund performance? "Returns are based on past results and are not an indication of future performance." We all know that that is just boilerplate text that the law requires the prospectuses to include. It happens, however, to be quite true.</p>
<p>So when you observe that a fund has been a laggard, that's precisely how you should think about it: "has been", not "is". True, it may continue to be a laggard. Then again, it may not. Likewise, a fund that has just bloomed may not continue to blossom. As the poet Herrick wrote, "this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."</p>
<p>LTSave, in common with many financial planners and academic researchers, believes that the weight of the evidence from practical experience and from analysis after analysis argues against using recent performance as a guide to the selection of funds or stocks. Sure, there is some slight evidence that, over limited periods of history, past performance could have provided some limited indication of future performance. And sophisticated statistical analyses of performance might allow an investor to make a better than random guess as to which funds will do well and which poorly. But the transactions costs of buying and selling funds would likely devour the small advantage to be gained. There is one aspect of past performance that is, however, predictable: high fees. If your fund has charged you high fees in the past, thereby eating part of your lunch, it is likely to continue to do so.</p>
<p>LTSave, in the hope of a small advantage, tries to recommend funds whose recent performance has been robust. But we will not recommend switching out of a fund simply because of a downturn in relative performance. We prefer to think that the funds that we recommend have a mandate to fulfill: to continue to represent the asset classes that they were chosen to represent, and not to charge our clients an unreasonable amount of money for their services. If they fail to fulfill their mandate, then we will recommend switching out of them.</p>
<p>The ability to stomach the downs as well as the ups of fund or stock performance is a large component of what is meant by risk tolerance, at least in the financial context. An investor must also know her or his capacity to ride out the periods of poor performance and choose an appropriate mixture of assets. This is the value of diversification: by holding a mixture of assets, some of the risks of the individual assets cancel each other. The mixture of assets whose expected (but uncertain) behavior corresponds most closely with the investor's ability to accept that uncertain behavior is the asset class allocation that LTSave recommends. This, rather than a dubious ability to switch out of funds that are going to perform badly and into funds that will perform better, is the way an investor should plan to avoid bad investments.</p>
