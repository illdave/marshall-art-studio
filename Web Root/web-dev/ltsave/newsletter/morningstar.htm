		<h2>Evaluating Funds for Your Clients</h2>
		<p>By Julie Gross, Director, Investment Services</p>
		
		<p>Many financial professionals utilize Morningstar's ratings for mutual funds as part of their due diligence process when selecting funds for their clients. It is important to understand how the ratings are calculated as well as how they should be used to create a portfolio of mutual funds. We have put together some common questions and answers that address these issues and also discuss how LTSave evaluates funds.</p>
		
		<h3>1. What are the Morningstar ratings for funds?</h3>
		<p>Morningstar's fund star ratings were created to provide investors a single number (or, more accurately, a symbol) that represents how a mutual fund has historically balanced risk and return. The ratings provide the ability to compare different mutual funds' performance on a risk- and cost-adjusted basis.</p> 
		
		<h3>2. How is the Morningstar rating calculated?</h3>
		<p>The star rating is purely quantitative. Morningstar rates mutual funds from one to five stars based on how well they have performed (after making adjustments for risk and sales charges) relative to other funds within the same Morningstar category. Funds are rated for up to three time periods: three, five, and 10 years, and the ratings for these time periods are combined to produce an overall rating. Within each Morningstar category, the top 10% of funds receive five stars and the bottom 10% receives one star. Funds with less than three years of history are not rated.  
		<p>It is important to remember that the star rating takes into consideration only a fund's past risk/reward (performance) profile. As we all know, past performance is not an indication of future results, so the ratings should not be used alone when evaluating funds. Also, different share classes of the same fund may have different star ratings. For a full explanation of how Morningstar calculates the star rating, please visit Morningstar's website.</p> 
		
		<h3>3. How should the Morningstar rating for funds be used?</h3>
		<p>Morningstar ratings are widely used by financial professionals to help analyze and select funds to include in their clients' portfolios. Along with other criteria, the star ratings help these professionals screen the large mutual fund universe down to a workable group of funds. </p> 
		<p>Morningstar ratings can also be a useful tool to help monitor fund performance. For example, if a five star fund has moved to a single star, it is probably time to look more closely at the fund.  The poor rating could be the result of a handful of poor performing stocks within the portfolio, but a large shift in a fund's star rating might signal that there is something more significant  going on. The fund may have become riskier than it was before, or it may have had a change in the management team. The star ratings are calculated based on a specific numerical formula, and a number of factors could therefore be related to the cause of change in that rating. </p>
		<p>Morningstar even notes that the star rating should not be used as a signal to buy and sell funds. Morningstar recalculates funds' star ratings every month, and funds regularly gain or lose a star due to short-term factors. A fund is not automatically worth buying just because it has received a five star rating. There are 5-star funds in every category, so it is important to decide first which asset classes are right for the investor.  As mentioned earlier, since the star ratings are purely quantitative, a five star rating may not currently reflect qualitative issues affecting the fund, such as a manager or strategy change.</p> 
		
		<h3>4. How does LTSave evaluate and select funds?</h3>
		<p>LTSave begins its process by developing capital market expectations for six broad asset classes and uses these forecasts to create a set of model portfolios that are spread across the risk spectrum. 
		<p>LTSave evaluates funds primarily according to three criteria:</p> 
		
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Tracking Error:</strong> LTSave bases its advice on asset class allocation; therefore we look for funds that are broadly representative of the asset classes or asset subclasses that form the model portfolios. We do this by look at tracking error with respect to appropriate benchmarks for the asset classes. </li> 
			<li><strong>Expense Ratio:</strong> Because the client is, in general, best served by lower expenses rather than higher ones, LTSave tends to recommend funds with lower expense ratios among the options available within the asset classes.</li>  
			<li><strong>Reputation and History:</strong> LTSave tries to avoid funds with a history of poor performance or whose management company's commitment to its funds' shareholders has been called into question.</li> 
		</ol>
		<p>In addition, LTSave checks to make sure that the fund is not closed, and also checks on the amount of assets under management, with a view to avoiding funds that are too small (which would cause them to have cost disadvantages associated with small scale) or, in the case of actively managed funds, too large (which would render them too cumbersome to take advantage of market opportunities). LTSave assigns expected returns based upon the asset class exposures and its expectations for the asset classes.  LTSave does not score funds or forecast alphas. </p>

		<h3>5. How are Morningstar ratings factored in to LTSave's fund selection process? </h3>
		<p>LTSave's investment process does not include screening mutual funds using Morningstar's star ratings. Risk-adjusted performance is an important characteristic that LTSave studies, along with fund expense ratios and size. LTSave's investment process does, however, result in most of the fund selections possessing Morningstar star ratings of three or greater. In the instances where LTSave funds that have lower Morningstar ratings, these are generally the consequence of a few alternative choices being available to represent a given asset class needed for portfolio diversification. </p>
