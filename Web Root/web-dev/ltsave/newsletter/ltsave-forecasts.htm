		<h2>LTSave's Approach to Forecasts and Estimates!!!</h2>

		<p>By Adam Jared Apt, Vice President, Investment Team</p>
		<p>LTSave does not make quarter-by-quarter forecasts. Instead, each quarter, we think again about the long view, and revise our long-term outlook if this seems advisable. Our approach is based upon the concept of the time value of money.</p>
		<p>The time value of money recognizes that a dollar in the future is not necessarily worth the same as a dollar today. That's why it's necessary to discount future dollars, at an appropriate rate, to their present value, in order to have a basis for comparing different quantities of future dollars received at different times. In its simplest form, the time value of money means that if you put some number of dollars in a bank account, they will accrue interest and become a larger number of dollars in the future. You can convert the future dollars into an equivalent number of dollars today by applying an appropriate discount rate.</p>
		<p>Stocks are also subject to the time value of money. An investment in stock typically (but not always) grows over a long period of time to a greater value than the original investment, usually beating the rate of inflation. The most difficult question to answer is what the appropriate discount rate is to convert the future value into present value.</p>
		<p>It is generally agreed that what a stock is worth today is the present value of all the cash flows that will accrue to its owner. These cash flows are the dividends the owner will receive, along with the final value of the stock when sold. And what is the final value at sale? It's what the stock is worth to the next buyer, who estimates what he or she will receive in the form of the dividends paid out after taking ownership of the stock, plus its final sale value, and so on through all future owners.</p>
		<p>Not all stocks pay dividends, and even companies that pay dividends also sometimes buy back shares, thereby paying out cash to the owner in a form that isn't reflected in the dividends. Some may argue that earnings are more relevant that dividends. This is somewhat correct because earnings inevitably are reinvested in the business to pay for the growth of the company, so the value of the stock has to be less than the present value of its future earnings. In sum, the future cashflows received by the owner of a stock are somewhere between the dividends and the earnings.</p>
		<p>LTSave estimates the returns for U.S. stocks by taking a familiar stock index, the S&P 500, and estimating future dividends and earnings. This is done by smoothing the dividends and earnings of recent years and projecting those forward on a reasonable assumption of the growth of the overall national economy. If the government's share of GDP isn't growing, then the expected growth rate of the economy should be similar to the expected growth rate of major companies, represented by the S&P 500. Because we know with certainty the present value of the (estimated) future cashflows to the owner of the S&P 500 -- the present value is just the value of the S&P 500 right now -- we can calculate what discount rate will equate those future cashflows to their present value. That discount rate is the expected (nominal) rate of return on the S&P 500, over the long term.</p>
		<p>LTSave calculates this discount rate twice, once for dividends and once for earnings, and then settles on an intermediate value as its long-term forecast of the return to large-capitalization U.S. stocks (as a group).</p>
		<p>This is a reasonable approach, but there is a lot of uncertainty in estimating future dividends and earnings, and in estimating the growth of the economy. Despite this, LTSave's long-term forecast for stocks is close to those of other economic and investment analysts who have there own ways of forecasting the market. For example, our current estimate for the S&P 500 is 7.11% per year before adjusting for inflation.</p>
		<p>So our quarterly recalculation looks again at recent dividends and earnings, at the latest estimates of the growth of the U.S. economy, and at the current level of the S&P 500. In our experience, the net result of these new numbers and calculations changes very little from quarter to quarter.</p>
