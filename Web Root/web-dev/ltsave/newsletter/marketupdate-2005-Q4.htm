		<h4>U.S. Equity Markets</h4>
		<p>The major US stock indices produced modest gains for the fourth quarter as well as for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow ended the year with returns of 4.9% and 1.7%, respectively.  Stocks were generally restrained during the year by a number of events including the war in Iraq, higher energy prices, Fed interest rate hikes, and natural disasters such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>
		<p>In spite of above the above events, however, selected areas of the markets did produce stronger returns. Mid-cap stocks, both growth and value oriented, returned over 12% for the year and real estate, particularly REITs, produced almost a 14% return for 2005, following two extremely strong performing years. Energy stocks continued to perform well through the end of the year, returning over 30%.</p>
		
		<h4>U.S. Bond Markets</h4>
		<p>The Federal Reserve continued its campaign of steadily increasing interest rates during the quarter, raising the Federal Funds rate to 4.25% on December 13th.  Recent Fed comments seem to indicate that Fed officials are becoming less concerned about inflation and are likely to adopt a more neutral position regarding rates. As a result, market indications are that interest rate increases will likely come to an end in the next few months. In this environment, bonds produced only small gains for the quarter and year.</p>
		<p>The year ended with some investors taking a more cautious view regarding the prospects of the U.S. markets due to an inverted yield curve -- an infrequent occurrence where longer-term Treasury yields are below shorter-term Treasury rates. There is concern that this condition sometimes precedes a period of slower economic growth. Despite this situation, most financial experts do not see a recession in the next year due to the growth momentum of the economy. By the beginning of 2006, the yield curve had started to revert back to a more normal status, although relatively flat compared to more typical patterns.</p>

		<h4>International Markets</h4>
		<p>Foreign markets continued to perform exceptionally well and outperformed U.S. stocks for the third consecutive year in a row. Latin America was particularly strong, with the MSCI Latin America index producing a 45% return for the year. This region appears to be benefiting from higher oil prices and accelerated economic development. As a result, natural resources and telecommunication stocks were strong performers in this region. Japan also produced strong returns due to recent elections and an increase in domestic demand.</p>
