		<h2>What Can Advisers Do to Minimize <br />their Fiduciary Liability?</h2>
		<h4>If I Don't Have Enough Money for My Retirement <br />It Must Be Someone Else's Fault!</h4>
			
		<p>By Larry Heimlich,  Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing</p>
		<p>It's always someone else's fault if things don't go as planned. Spill a cup of hot coffee in your lap or damage your car by driving down a road marked "closed" and of course it's not your fault, it's someone else's. Unfortunately, today's highly litigious society makes it too easy to duck responsibility for one's actions, and that of course extends to the retirement industry.</p>
		<p>Every day we hear and read about lawsuits, mega-fines, and government actions that focus on the fiduciary responsibilities of financial institutions and professionals. What can financial professionals do to help protect themselves from potentially unpleasant actions of regulators, sponsors, and participants? The first thing is to make sure you have sufficient liability coverage. Next, make sure you have reputable legal counsel with ERISA experience. While there are no bulletproof ways to avoid a lawsuit or dispute, there are ways to mitigate the possibility of adverse actions from clients and participants.</p> 
		<p>One of these ways involves preparing an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that provides a framework and understanding of the sponsor's responsibilities and goals associated with a qualified retirement plan for employees. Although not yet required by any government agency, its existence and continual review provides a paper trail to support the claim that you acted in a prudent and responsible manner in establishing and managing the plan.</p>
		<p>There are some more practical reasons for offering an IPS. It offers the adviser an opportunity to provide a "value-added" professional service and document that represents the best interests of the client. This, along with quarterly reports that review investment performance in accordance with measures outlined in the IPS, enhances the professional image of the adviser.</p>
		<p>If you are like most professionals today, your most important resource is time, and you need more time to prospect, maintain existing relationships and develop new ones while dealing with shrinking margins and increased competition. So, how can you cost-effectively provide an IPS and quarterly monitoring reports? The answer is LTSave. LTSave's new Fiduciary Manager<sup>SM</sup>  is a web-enabled modular program that can provide a customized IPS within minutes. It also provides quarterly performance and watch list reports for investment lineups.</p>
		<p>LTSave is an SEC registered adviser and can also act as a co-fiduciary and <em>complement</em> the activities of the adviser with automated account management services for the average participant. By outsourcing this responsibility, the adviser has more time to spend with senior plan sponsor managers or owners or to pursue new relationships.</p>
		<p>LTSave's mission is to help advisers, sponsors, and participants with cost-effective professional solutions that will help to enhance relationships and provide a measure of fiduciary protection. If you'd like to learn more about these services please contact us.</p>
