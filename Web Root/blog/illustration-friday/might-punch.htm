									<p>All-new art, rendered in Corel Painter's Acrylic tools. No glazing, one-layer, no research. I'm getting better at the modeling, but can't pull it off consistently. I'm aiming for clarity first, style consistency second. To be honest, I spent so much time rendering, I can't tell if the drawing is funny anymore.</p>

									<p class="footnote"><a href="../../illustration-friday/index.htm">Illustration Friday</a> (IF, iFriday) was a weekly challenge to illustrate a one-word theme (wind, smoke, invention, etc.) globally announced on Friday nights. It was similar in spirit to Photo Friday, 24 Hour Comics, 48 Hour Films, and Sketchcrawl. Participants usually posted on their own blogs, then shared links to various iFriday boards. This is from my 2006-2007 participation.</p>

											<p><span class="dateline">December 5, 2006 at 11:40 PM</span> Before I read the caption I saw that and it brought the pain of my own lappy going haywire last week. Just out of curiousity...could you post the thumbnail? It's always nice to see where the work originated (and I just posted a bit dealing somewhat with your 'fears'...sometimes the computer takes so long vs. traditional media you can feel like you are 'overworking'a piece and something can get lost in the translation...)</p>

												<p><span class="dateline">December 6, 2006 at 8:30 AM)</span> Getting the thumbnail's a bit more involved than it should be. This IF drawing is a recreation of one of my old freelance illustrations. The commissioned version was done rendered as vector art, but the thumbnail sketches are traditional marker-on-paper. I'd have to turn the house upside down in hopes that it didn't get trashed in one of my many moving purges. As a part-time art teacher, I can see why you'd value the process drawings. While the ancient marker thumbnails may be gone, I still have the original published version. Can I send you that, plus the IF pencil (Photoshop) art. Would that help?</p>

I'm slowly going through and filing the stuff. I would be more than happy to see the items you mention! If you don't want to post them, there is a link under my profile name you can mail them to. I really try to push the process for not only customer/client relations but also because it helps to keep a record of one's own progress and help to make one's own work better.</p>

											<p><span class="dateline">December 6, 2006 at 12:52 AM</span> Excellent. I like the way the muscles and clothing are rendered. Kind of Thomas Hart Benton-ish. Very cool!</p>

												<p class="person">So I said...</p>
												<p><span class="dateline">December 6, 2006 at 8:30 AM)</span> Thanks for the reference. I hadn't seen Benton's work since my 1980s art student days. Looks like he had more of an impression on me than anyone'd've guessed. Thomas Hart Benton Links:</p>

											<p><span class="dateline">December 6, 2006 at 1:09 AM</span> A beautiful style, and very clear composition! And a really terrific idea! The only thing I'd say is his arm and hand (the punch receiver...) seems a little to big comparatively. This has a beautiful painterly quality! Well done!</p>	
											<div class="reply">
												<p class="person">So I said...</p>
												<p><span class="dateline">December 6, 2006 at 8:30 AM)</span> You're right. I was aiming for a <a href="http://lambiek.net/artists/k/kirby.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Kirby</a> exaggerated violence approach. Combining that 1960s Marvel Comics energy with the Thomas Hart Benton painterly approach is tougher than it looks.</p>
