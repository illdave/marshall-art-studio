													<h3>New England Black Weekly</h3>
													<p>Freelance Illustrator, Production Artist</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1980</span> Boston-based newspaper. My first professional gig. While still a freshman at MassArt, I was introduced to the hectic pace of a startup news organization being run on a shoestring budget. This training would prove to be helpful in future editorial assignments (<em>The Boston Edge, Citizen's Group Papers, Urban Beat, Computerworld</em>). Our main competitor was the Bay State Banner. In this crazy time, we swore to bury them.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>Okay, so they buried us. There just wasn't enough of a target audience to support two similar publications.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>Vision Machine Research</h3>
													<p>Freelance Storyboard Artist, Production Artist, Graphic Designer</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1983</span> Startup, cutting-edge video game developer. The major project was creating the 3-D photographic technique used in today's most popular games. Like most startups, the organization was run on a shoestring, the hours were long, and moral was great until checks started bouncing.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>By my sketchy memory, the lead programmer bolted for another firm.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>The Boston Edge</h3>
													<p>Freelance Illustrator</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1986</span> A weekly arts and entertainment newspaper. I provided front-page and interior op-ed illustrations. Like most startups, the organization was run on a shoestring, the hours were long, and moral was great until checks started bouncing.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>Our main competitor was a little mom-and-pop outfit called the <em>Boston Phoenix</em>. 'Nuff Said.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>Gregory Fossella Associates</h3>
													<p>Production Artist, Graphic Designer</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1988</span> In it's heyday, this industrial design firm was internationally famous. Not bad for my first professional day job. I was Junior Production Artist (a.k.a "Stat Rat") Through hard work and a willingness to learn, I was promoted to Junior Graphic Designer. This was my introduction to real-world fundamental production techniques needed to make professional-level printed work.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>Mr. Fossella's old-world philosophy became outdated by the late '80s.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>Citizen's Group Papers</h3>
													<p>Freelance Illustrator</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1990</span> A group of Boston-based small-town weekly newspapers (<em>Allston-Brighton Citizen's Item, Brookline Citizen's Item,</em> etc). I started off in the Production department, which was still doing traditional paste-up at the time. After seeing my editorial illustration experience (<em>New England Black Weekly, Boston Edge</em>), the editors started using my <a href="../illustration/index.html">high-concept Op-Ed illustrations</a>.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>General decline of newspaper readership.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>The Urban Beat</h3>
													<p>Freelance Graphic Designer, Illustrator, Production Artist</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1992</span> Startup, Boston-based newspaper. I obviously didn't learn my lesson from my experience at the New England Black Weekly. I took over the design chores from a burnt-out graphic designer, designing and producing the entire publication from the ground up. Worked closely with the one-man Editor, Publisher and CEO. Converted the digital art from Aldus PageMaker to Quart XPress. Redesigned the logo and provided <a href="../illustration/index.html">editorial illustration</a>. This was all done on a Mac Plus, so lots of time was spent hitting the return key and waiting. Our main competitor was the <em>Bay State Banner</em>. In this crazy time, we swore to bury them.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>There just wasn't enough of a target audience to support two similar publications. The Editor overextended himself, and ultimately couldn't generate enough content or advertising dollars for the company to survive.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>Midnight Oil Studios</h3>
													<p>Graphic Designer</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 1993</span> Independent design and marketing agency. At the time I was hired, computers (hardware by Apple, software from Adobe and Aldus) were beginning to take the place of traditional creative and production tools (stat cameras, mechanicals). Our clients were major advertising agencies and shopping mall conglomerates.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>A disagreement between the principals split Midnight Oil Studios in two independent companies, one in San Francisco and the other New York City.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>ITG Department of Merrill Lynch</h3>
													<p>UI Designer, Front-End Web Developer, One-Man Art Department</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 2003</span> My introduction to cutting-edge web development (ASP, CSS, DHTML, dynamic Javscript). Merrill Lynch, based in Hopewell NJ, bought startup company ITG to create <a href="../web-dev/merril-lynch/index.htm">web tools for banking and day-trading</a>.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>With the internet economy crash, Merrill decided it didn't need to finance a remote office in Cambridge.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>Publicom</h3>
													<p>Freelance Graphic Designer, Illustrator, Production Artist</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 2004</span> Worked on porting <a href="../illustration/index.html">Reader Rabbit content from CD ROM to printed workbooks</a>. Developed page layouts and illustrations from start to finish.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>Publicom was experiencing clash flow problems.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job">
													<h3>LTSave</h3> 
													<p>UI Designer, Front-End Web Developer, One-Man Art Department</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 2006</span> I was brought in to skin the <a href="../web-dev/ltsave/index.htm">flagship website</a>, design print material, fashion apparel, and Powerpoint presentations.</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>After spending three years enthusiastically building a product, we couldn't find enough consumer customers.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="rip-job" hidden>
													<h3>FooJob</h3> 
													<p>FooTitle</p>
													<p><span class="date-range">RIP 0000</span> FooStory</p>
													<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
													<p>FooWrong</p>
